That led the doctors to label you \"growth restricted,\" which meant you needed a bit more monitoring than normal. I argued that you can't punish a girl for being extra fit, but they wouldn't budge.\n\nOverall it just meant more doctors appointments, more tests, and more cool pics of you. You were a sleepy little baby which made them nervous a couple times that you weren't doing well. So they'd get out this buzzer thing and buzz you through your mom's belly, which usually woke you up pretty good. \n\nPoor baby just wanted to lounge and you were getting buzzed by strange forces from beyond the womb!",

There was a lot of Netflix and reading. Your mom had decided to try and give birth without medication, and at that point we were feeling like labor might be a cakewalk. \n\nBut then she felt something go down her leg, and we called the nurses in. Her water had broken, and it turns out the fun was just beginning. ",

Labor was ramping up a notch. \n\nOver the next couple of hours, she sweated and squirmed in the hospital bed. She finally decided enough was enough, and wanted an epidural to help ease the pain. The nurses started giving her fluids to prepare, and gave a heads up to the anesthesiologist. In the meantime, we tried to keep the mood as chill as possible.\n\nWhen the nurse came to check in, she heard something that made her pause. “Wait a minute Elizabeth, are you grunting? You aren't feeling the need to push right now, are you?” \n\nThey checked your mom and realized that over the past hour, things had progressed much faster than expected.  You were closer to making your grand entrance than anyone realized. \n\nAll of a sudden, things moved very quickly. They called our delivery doctor, Dr. Felly, who left home to drive in. They wheeled in a big table to the foot of your mom's bed, and started coaching her on how to properly push you out. Right then the anesthesiologist walked in, bringing over the epidural. He'd missed the memo - there wasn’t enough time for medication anymore. Minutes later, Dr. Felly ran in saying \"I just hit every green light to get here!\" \n\nYour mom wanted to change the vibes of the music - something louder to distract her, so I put our wedding dance floor playlist on shuffle. And then we held her legs back and started counting down for her to push, 10 seconds at a time. \n\nAnd that’s the story of how, amidst all of the mayhem, you came into this world to the song \"Hold on, I’m Comin,\" a real tone setter. ",
